1. Window class with:
    1.1 Title frame:
        # text centered in frame, frame has a rectangular black border around it
    1.2 File/dir entry frame:
        # Entry object with automatic validation of entered file path
        # "Open" button next to entry object that prompts file explorer
        # Red error text below it if path invalid
    1.3 Selenium/Browser frame
        1.3.1 Radio Buttons to select Firefox or Chrome on the left side
        1.3.2 "Browser Ã¶ffnen" button that calls Selenium on the right side
            # Greyed-out until file/dir has been specified
            # Greys out upon pressing
            # Checks whether Browser and Driver are installed correctly, throws up infobox if not, prints exception to large textbox
	    # Starts a Selenium Listener that periodically checks whether Selenium is still running, raises an infobox if not
    1.4 Large textbox that gives something akin to a log of what data has been saved
        # Editable with window.log(str) command

2. Selenium core loop as a function
    2.1 Gets called as a seperate thread via 1.3, args: window, dict with data
    2.2 Runs:
	2.2.1 Opens to moodle start page
        2.2.2 Awaits /mod/quiz in URL (URL of all tests)
        2.2.3 While loop that keeps checking page for changes (every 0.1s)
        2.2.4 Upon loading of new page:
            # Compares q_num ID to entries in data struct, adds question to data struct if so
            # Checks for changes to answers, adjusts answers in data struct if so
            # Puts all new entries in a new = [] list and all modifications into a modified = [] list, prints both to log (1.4) via 2.3 and 2.4 at end of loop
	2.2.5 If no q_num on new page:
	    # Use 2.4 to say no new elements found on this page
            # Advise on closing the browser; maybe through an infobox?
    2.3 get_string() function that can turn dict entry into string for logbox (1.4)
    2.4 log() function that logs all changes to the logbox (1.4) as well as a text file (only new entries go to text file tho)

3. Data structure
    3.1 Will be saved into dict of structure: {q_num: {'index': index of question,
							'question': question text,
							'answers': {a1 text: bool(selected),
								    a2 text: bool(selected),
								    ...}	}
    3.2 Will be a global variable, so even if Selenium crashes, it can still be restarted and keep collecting just fine.
